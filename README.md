#### Task 01
<p align="justify">FindNthRoot algorithm calculates nth root of a real number to a specified accuracy by using Newton-Raphson method.</p> 

<p align="justify">First of all, an initial guess for a possible root is made, which is set to be a half of the input number. 
Then Newton's formula is applied repeatedly, until required accuracy id reached. To fix floating-point calculations errors, 
the final result is rounded to specified number of digits.
For some input values ArgumentOutOfRangeException is thrown, e.g. accuracy of calculation should be given as
some negative power of 10 or negative numbers have only odd-degree roots. NUnit unit test are provided.</p>
